    There may be occasions when the University deems an assignment offered to you to amount to regulated activity
    within the meaning of the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006.  Before you, or any substitute tutor or
    lecturer, can be allowed to carry out such an assignment, the University requires receipt of an appropriate
    Disclosure and Barring Service check or Certificate of Good Conduct which is acceptable to the University.
