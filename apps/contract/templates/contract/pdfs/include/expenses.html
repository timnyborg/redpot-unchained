    Reasonable travel expenses will be paid upon submission of a Claim Form and all relevant receipts to the Course
    Administrator. The most economical means and class of travel should be utilised. Where agreed, the Department will
    pay bus or rail travel (standard class only), short distance taxi journeys (where public transport was not
    feasible), and mileage (for cars) at a rate of 45p per mile for the first 10,000 miles in each tax year.
    Mileage is not paid for journeys of less than 5 miles. Should you have any questions about other permissible
    expenses, please contact the Course Administrator.

    Other reasonable expenses may be reimbursed if pre-authorised by Department. The purchase of books and other
    teaching materials can only be reimbursed with the prior agreement of the Department, in which case they will be
    considered the property of the Department.
</p>
<p>
    Please submit the form within two weeks of incurring the expense. Failure to provide the Claim Form in time could
    mean that the University will not pay the claimed expenses. Please note that the reimbursement of expenses for
    travel to and from the place of work is regarded by the HMRC as payment of fees and hence subject to deduction of
    Tax and National Insurance Contributions.
